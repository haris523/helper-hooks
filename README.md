# helper-hooks

## Description

This package contains hooks that were mainly made for react-native, but they also might work for react. 
Current hooks in this package are:

Hook name | Return values
--- | --- | --- 
useArray | 200

## Update

I will continue adding hooks to this package whenever I need to use some of them inside a project.
