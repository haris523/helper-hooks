# helper-hooks

## Description

This package contains hooks that were mainly made for react-native, but they also might work for react. 
Current hooks in this package are:

useArray

Return value | Description
--- | ---
push | Adds an element to the end of the array
pop | Removes the last item in the array and returns it

## Update

I will continue adding hooks to this package whenever I need to use some of them inside a project.
